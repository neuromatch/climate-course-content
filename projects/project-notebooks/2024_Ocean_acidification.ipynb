    "Human activities release CO2 into the atmosphere, which leads to atmospheric warming and climate change. A portion of this CO2 released by human activities is absorbed into the oceans, which has a direct, chemical effect on seawater, known as ocean acidification. When CO2 combines with water in the ocean it forms carbonic acid, which makes the ocean more acidic and can have negative impacts on certain marine ecosystems (e.g., reduce the ability of calcifying organisms to form their shells and skeletons). The degree of ocean acidification is often expressed in terms of the pH of seawater, which is the measure of acidity or alkalinity such that a pH below 7 is considered acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is considered alkaline, or basic. Additional background information on ocean acidification can be found [here](https://coastadapt.com.au/ocean-acidification-and-its-effects). In this project, you will explore spatial and temporal patterns of and relationships between pH, CO2, and temperature to assess changes in ocean acidification and the impact on marine ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this project**, you will analyse ocean model and observational data from global databases to extract variables like pH, CO<sub>2</sub>, and temperature, and to investigate ocean acidification process in your region of interest. This project will also be an opportunity to investigate the relationships between these variables as well as their impact on the marine ecosystems."
