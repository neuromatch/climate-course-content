# Professional Development

Ahead of the course, we will offer a variety of Professional Development opportunities. During the course, you will engage with Impact Talks. 

## Why Professional Development?

Professional development enables students to connect and expand their experiences, skills and interest, broadening students’ perception of how they can make an impact via different career options. 

Specifically, students will:

* Watch recorded interviews on selected topics, relevant to a more just climate science
* Reflect and share how they and their work may relate to those selected topics


## Impact Talks

**Recorded interviews** of practitioners sharing their perspectives on topics relevant to a more just climate science. Impact talks aim to foster discussion, reflection, and self-discovery inside and outside the course.
