    "# Load ERA5 Reanalysis Data via the CDS API\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this notebook was used to create the input data for Tutorial 2 using the ERA5 Reanalysis dataset computed by the European Copernicus Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home). It is provided here to give a better idea of how climate data can be obtained, in this case through an [API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to). CDS's machinery of working with Reanalysis (and other) data is very powerful and immensely useful. It was decided to download the data separately and load it from OSF in Tutorial 2 as it is not necessary (and too time-consuming) for every participant to sign up for an account and run this operation, unnecessarily using computing resources and blocking queues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, this is the way you can access large amounts of data assimilation (measurement-model) output that has been stored in the cloud. This is very useful to get easy access to such information. Feel free to modify the code to access different data and address your research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before accessing data this way, please familiarize yourself with the CDS API documentation and resources linked within this notebook and listed at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code works by setting up a rather large query, resulting in a download that is possible after creating a personal account. The actual computation is triggered by running the last cell of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please DO NOT simply run it straightaway after modifications, the code takes quite a long time to run depending on the number of variables as well as temporal and spatial resolution, and thereby uses significant computing resources. Think first about what is it that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our example can give you a good idea of what data can be accessed via the CDS API, and Tutorial 2 of what can be done with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Get excited, go explore, have fun!"
