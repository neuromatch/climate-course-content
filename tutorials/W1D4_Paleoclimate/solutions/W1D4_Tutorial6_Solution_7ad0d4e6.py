1. There are cyclical variations in d18O that record glacial and interglacial periods. Higher-than-standard global concentrations of light oxygen in ocean water indicate that global temperatures have warmed (i.e. an interglacial period), whereas higher-than-standard global concentrations of heavy oxygen in ocean water indicate that global temperatures were cooler (i.e. a glacial period).
2. It appears as if the amplitudes of the glacial-interglacial cycles increased over the past 1 million years. Specifically, the amplitude changes ~700,000 years ago.
3. It's difficult to determine the temporal frequency at which these glacial-interglacial cycles occur by just looking at the time series. We will explore a computational tool to more accurately determine the length of these cycles. By eye, you might note a ~100,000 year cycle however, among others that are harder to discern.
