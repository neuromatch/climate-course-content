    "2. **Develop a scenario**: By moving the sliders and changing the assumptions, find a scenario (i.e. a combination of slider positions of different variables) that results in *less than 2°C* of temperature increase by the end of the century. Use the following [cheatsheet](https://img.climateinteractive.org/2019/09/EnROADS-one-page-guide-to-control-panel-v11-dec-2021.pdf) if needed. \n",

    "    3. **Winners & Losers**: Who would be the biggest winners and losers globally in your proposed future? Create a table with two columns for winners and losers. \n",
    "    4. **Narrative**: Map your ideas in the narrative space, introduced in Tutorial 5. \n",
    "    5. **Hope**: What trends in the world give you hope that your proposals are possible?\n",

    "In this last tutorial, you went from model to action by designing your own socioeconomic modeling scenario to limit global warming below 2°C by the end of the century. You reflected on its challenges, political feasibility, inherent winners and losers of your approach, and finally, the narrative that you chose. At the end of the day, you collected observations of actions and trends you are making in your region, globally, and in your daily life that give hope. That hope and various solutions exist, which one has to combine, and that only action is needed, might be the most important lesson of today.\n"
