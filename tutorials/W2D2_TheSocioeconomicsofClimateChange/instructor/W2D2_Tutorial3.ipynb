    "You might have recognized that a high ***carbon price*** by default has a strong impact on the temperature increase within the En-ROADS model as it both reduces the carbon intensity of the energy supply and reduces the energy demand. However, the carbon price itself could be introduced now or in 50 years and at different amounts, depending on for example the social cost of such a policy, which makes energy supply more expensive depending on its emissions. Energy producers could pass additional costs to their customers, so policy could be designed to minimize the impacts on the poorest, e.g. by introducing a [Carbon fee and dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend). \n",
