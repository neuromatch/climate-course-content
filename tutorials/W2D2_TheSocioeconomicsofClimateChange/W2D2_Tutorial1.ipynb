    "# Tutorial objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "*Estimated timing of tutorial:* 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first week of the course, you applied computational tools to climate data (measurements, proxies, and model output) to characterize past, present, and future climate.  During day one of this second week (W2D1), you began to explore climate model data from Earth System Model (ESM) simulations conducted for the recent Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that are presented in the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/)). However, the dominant source of uncertainty in those projections arises from how human society responds: e.g. how our emissions reduction and renewable energy technologies develop, how coherent our global politics are, how our consumption grows (cf. [Rogelj et al. (2018)(Global Warming of 1.5°C. An IPCC Special Report \\[...\\])](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157940.004)). For these reasons, in addition to understanding the physical basis of the climate variations projected by these models, it's also important to assess the current and future socioeconomic impact of climate change and what aspects of human activity are driving emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This day's tutorials focus on the socioeconomic projections regarding the future of climate change and are centered around the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) framework used by the IPCC. However, in this first tutorial, you will use the [En-ROADS](https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/) simulator to get some intuition about different socioeconomic variables and their consequences for climate. Additionally, you will analyze potential economic and population scenarios to learn about the complex and intertwined dynamics of socioeconomic variables, as well as how this model informs modern-day climate challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the rest of the days of this course, this day will be highly conceptual and discussion-driven, and focus much less on analyzing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Get familiar with the interface of the simulator named En-ROADS\n",
    "- Explore the impact of different growth variables on the temperature increase by 2100 projected from the En-ROADS model.\n",
    "- Understand why it is necessary to implement various actions against climate change, not a single one.\n",
    "- Explore the assumptions and limitations of this model"

    "1. At first, En-ROADS is a world model, not an optimal planning model so it is unlike any IAM used e.g. for the IPCC reports.\n",
    "Controls are somewhat limited (DAC/CCS, soil, BioChar, and mineralization are not covered).\n",
    "It allows only for single parameter changes -  in reality, there will be correlations, e.g. between carbon pricing and renewables due to market pressure.\n",
    "Some feedbacks are also missing, besides the above-mentioned damage from climate change on GDP, land use, etc.,\n",
    "climate change harms the human population by shortening lives.\n",
    "Although this happens already in the current 1°C increase reality, this harm is difficult to quantify and hence not implemented.\n",
    "Furthermore, it is a fully aggregated model, no spatial/regional or income resolution, and corresponding interdependency exists.\n",
    "An action/ policy is assumed to be executed globally, which is a utopia so far.\n",
    "It hence remains important to consider the implications of heterogeneity across different countries and their interactions.\n",
    "Last but not least, tipping points such as the thawing of the permafrost are represented in a very simplified manner only, although they probably have strong implications.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you got an intuition for various 'control knobs' that can be turned in a socio-economic model environment. We discussed why no policy alone can be a silver bullet to solve all problems but a mixture of many actions, in particular, the energy transition to renewables and carbon pricing. At last, we discussed a few limitations of the En-ROADs model approach."
