    "In the previous tutorial, we learned about the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a specific atmosphere-ocean dynamical phenomenon. You will now examine the atmosphere and the ocean systems more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn to work with reanalysis data. These data combine observations and models of the Earth system and are a critical tool for weather and climate science. You will first access a specific reanalysis dataset: ECMWF's ERA5. You will then select variables and slices of interest from the preprocessed file, investigating how important climate variables change on medium-length timescales (hours to months) within a certain region.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Access reanalysis data of climatically important variables. \n",
    "- Plot interactive maps to explore changes on various time scales.\n",
    "- Compute and compare time series of different variables from reanalysis data."

    "**Reanalysis** refers to the process of combining historical observations from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, satellite measurements, and ocean buoys, with numerical models to create a comprehensive and consistent record of past weather and climate conditions. Reanalysis data is a useful tool to examine the Earth's climate system over a wide range of time scales, from seasonal through decadal to century-scale changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple Earth system reanalysis products (e.g. MERRA-2, NCEP-NCAR, JRA-55C, [see an extensive list here](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/atmospheric-reanalysis-overview-comparison-tables)), and no single product fits all needs. For this tutorial, you will be using a product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) called **ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5)**. [This video](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis) from the ECMWF provides you with a brief introduction to the ERA5 product."
