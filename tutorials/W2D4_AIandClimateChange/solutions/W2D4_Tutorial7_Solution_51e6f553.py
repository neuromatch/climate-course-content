Discussion: Visual similarity is intuitive, but quantitative metrics (e.g., RMSE, correlation) are needed to rigorously evaluate emulator quality.
Confidence also comes from generalization: does the emulator work on unseen scenarios?
Trust is built by balancing quantitative validation with domain understanding â€” knowing when small differences matter scientifically.
