The more trees and the deeper they are, the more free parameters the model has to capture the training data. If the model has too low of capacity, it won't be powerful enough to capture complex relationships between the input features and the target variable. If it has too many parameters that it can move around, however, it may end up memorizing every single training point and therefore overfit.\n",

    "1. Observations: Adjusting `n_estimators` and `max_depth` may cause fluctuations in model performance. Increasing `n_estimators` initially improves performance, but too many trees may lead to overfitting. Similarly, increasing `max_depth` initially enhances performance by capturing complex patterns, but excessively deep trees may result in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Capacity and Overfitting: Capacity refers to a model's ability to capture complex patterns, while overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of true patterns. Increasing capacity, like using more trees or deeper trees, can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preventing Overfitting: Apart from adjusting model capacity, we could also consider training on a larger dataset. Machine learning techniques like regularization techniques, cross-validation, feature selection, and ensemble methods help prevent overfitting. These approaches ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data by balancing complexity and performance.\n",
