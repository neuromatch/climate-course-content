    "All SSP projections are created by optimizing economic activity within the constraint of a given level of greenhouse gas forcing at 2100 (bottom right in the above plot). This activity drives distinct temperature changes via the emissions it produces (top right), which are inputted into a damage function to compute economic damages. These damages feedback into the economy model to limit emissions-producing economic activity (top left).\n",
    "*Note that we already explored these damage functions along our En-ROADS climate solution simulator in Tutorial 2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forcing constraint ensures the amount of emissions produced is consistent for that particular scenario. In other words, the projected temperature change under different scenarios is fed to a socioeconomic model component in order to assess the socioeconomic impacts resulting from the temperature change associated with each SSP. *For examples of such impacts check out today's Tutorial 2 and W2D4.*\n",

    "Not every variable in IAMs is endogenous (i.e. determined by other variables in the model). Some variables, like population or technology growth, are exogenous (i.e. variables whose time course is given to the model). In this case, the time course of, e.g., population and economic growth, are derived from simple growth models. These exogenous variables are assumed to be under our society's control (e.g. via mitigation).\n",
