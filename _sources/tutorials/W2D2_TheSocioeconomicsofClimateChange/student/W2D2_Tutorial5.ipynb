    "# Section 1: Background on IAM Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "The last tutorial gave us a glimpse of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), a class of models economists use to inform policy decisions. Recall that IAMs couple a climate model to an economic model, allowing us to evaluate the two-way coupling between economic productivity and climate change severity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a brief recall of the IAM features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IAMs resolve the economy spatially, in contrast, the toy model En-ROADS for example, which we applied in Tutorial 1 to 3, aggregates all variables and is non-spatial.\n",
    "- Like En-ROADS, the world models used in IAMs usually have *exogeneous* (externally set) times series for variables, in addition to fixed world system parameters. These exogenous variables are assumed to be under our society's control (e.g. mitigation). \n",
    "- IAMs come equipped with an objective function (a formula that calculates the quantity to be optimized). This function returns the value of a projected future obtained from running the world model under a given climate policy. This value is defined by the time series of these exogenous variables. In this sense, the objective function is what defines \"good\" in \"good climate policy\". \n",
    "- The computation in an IAM is then an optimization of this objective as a function of the time series of these exogenous variables over some fixed time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most IAMs are based on *Neo-classical economics* (also referred to as \"establishment economics\"). This is an approach to economics that makes particular assumptions. For example, it is assumed that production, consumption, and valuation of goods and services are driven solely by the supply and demand model. One fundamental concept is *utility* (i.e. economic value), which is not only central to economics but also to decision theory as a whole, which is a research field that mathematically formalizes the activity of *planning* (planning here means selecting strategies based on how they are expected to play out given a model that takes those strategies and projects forward into the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "Six of the most well-established IAMs have been chosen to represent a certain SSP narrative as discussed by Max in the video. Their simulations result in energy use and emissions characteristics for the respective SSP. These narratives try to describe broad socioeconomic trends that are plausible while reflecting worlds in which mitigation and adaptation challenges vary from low to very high.\n"

    "This feature space is one way to dissect the narratives that underlie the SSPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A consideration of the future socio-economic situation in the light of the resulting challenges is also fruitful. For example, low challenges to mitigation and adaptation due to rapid technological development, relative global equality of income and focus on environmental sustainability arise in SSP1. SSP4, on the other hand, features similarly low challenges to mitigation due to its rapid technological development, but high challenges to climate adaptation due to persistent inequality and poverty in many parts of the world (cf. [Carbon Brief Explainer, Hausfather, 2018](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)). \n",
    "Note that mitigation and adaptation responses are not implemented in the SSPs, such that other studies can assess the effects of policies and of impacts by comparing outcomes to those in the reference SSPs. Hence, a large number of studies investigate a variety of policies and projected risks (cf. [O'Neill et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00952-0)).\n",
