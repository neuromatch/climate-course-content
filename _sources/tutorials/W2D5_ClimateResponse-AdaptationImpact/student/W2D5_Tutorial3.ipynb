    "In this tutorial, we delved into the importance of training and testing sets in constructing robust machine learning models. Understanding the concept of overfitting and the necessity of using separate test sets for model assessment were pivotal. Through practical exercises, we acquired hands-on proficiency in data partitioning, model training, and performance evaluation.\n"
