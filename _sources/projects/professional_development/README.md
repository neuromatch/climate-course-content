## [See the Professional Development Schedule here.](https://docs.neuromatch.io/p/CpPZ_P0Tl9vv6s/2025-Academy-Professional-Development) 

## Why Professional Development?

Professional development enables students to connect and expand their experiences, skills and interest, broadening studentsâ€™ perception of how they can make an impact via different career options. 

Specifically, students will:

* Watch recorded interviews on selected topics, relevant to a more just climate science
* Reflect and share how they and their work may relate to those selected topics


## Impact Talks

**Recorded interviews** of practitioners sharing their perspectives on topics relevant to a more just climate science. Impact talks aim to foster discussion, reflection, and self-discovery inside and outside the course.
