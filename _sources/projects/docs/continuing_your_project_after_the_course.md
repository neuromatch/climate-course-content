# Climatematch Impact Scholars program

Scientific discovery takes time. Recognizing this, Neuromatch and Climatematch Academy, in collaboration with the [**Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP)**](https://leap.columbia.edu/), a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Science & Technology Center based at Columbia University, offer the Climate Impact Scholars program. This program provides selected student groups with access to computing resources for 6 months after the courses end, allowing scholars to further develop projects initiated during the courses or to explore new projects provided by the academies or our partners. 
Scholars will benefit from the mentorship of experienced researchers who will provide guidance, constructive feedback, and professional insights over the course of 10 months, from October 2024 to March 2025, enhancing the quality and impact of their work. 
Additionally, scholars will have the chance to present their research to seasoned experts, gaining valuable feedback and engaging with a broader scientific community. 
This program also includes the opportunity to showcase their projects at the Academies Open Ceremony, inspiring future scholars and demonstrating the significance of their research.
